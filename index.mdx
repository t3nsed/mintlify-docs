AgentOS runs AI agents that handle the tedious parts of building software: writing code, creating pull requests, deploying to production. You describe what you want, and agents figure out how to make it happen.

## What AgentOS does

You talk to the Operator, an AI assistant that understands your product goals. When something needs to get built, the Operator spins up specialized agents that work in parallel. Each agent runs in its own isolated environment, writes code, and opens pull requests for review.

The agents can:

- Clone your GitHub repository and make changes
- Create and merge pull requests
- Deploy to Vercel
- Work on multiple tasks simultaneously
