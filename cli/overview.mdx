The AgentOS CLI lets you manage workspaces, talk to the Operator, and run macros from your terminal. Output is JSON by default, which makes it easy for scripts and AI agents to work with.

## Install

One command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://useagentos.com/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the right binary for your system and puts it in `~/.local/bin`. Works on macOS, Linux, and WSL.

Check that it worked:

```bash
agentos health
```

You should see:

```json
{ "ok": true, "backendUrl": "https://api.useagentos.com" }
```

## Download manually

If you'd rather grab the binary yourself, check the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/actaso/arche/releases). Pick the one for your system:

| File                   | System                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `agentos-darwin-arm64` | Mac with Apple Silicon |
| `agentos-darwin-x64`   | Mac with Intel         |
| `agentos-linux-arm64`  | Linux ARM              |
| `agentos-linux-x64`    | Linux x64              |

Then make it executable and move it somewhere in your PATH:

```bash
chmod +x agentos-darwin-arm64
mv agentos-darwin-arm64 ~/.local/bin/agentos
```

## Log in

You need an AgentOS account to use the CLI. If you don't have one, sign up at [useagentos.com](https://useagentos.com) first.

```bash
agentos auth login
```

This opens your browser. Sign in, approve the request, and you're done. The CLI stores your credentials locally.

## Try it out

List your workspaces:

```bash
agentos workspaces list
```

Talk to the Operator:

```bash
agentos operator chat ws_abc123 --message "What's the status of my project?"
```

Check available macros:

```bash
agentos macros list
```

## Output format

Everything returns JSON. If you want it formatted for humans:

```bash
agentos workspaces list --output pretty
```
