## Sign up

Go to [useagentos.com](https://useagentos.com) and create an account. You can sign in with your existing credentials through WorkOS.

## Create a workspace

After signing in, you'll go through a short onboarding flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name your project">
    Enter a name for your company or project. This becomes your workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe what you're building">
    Tell AgentOS what you want to build. Be specific about the product, its features, and your goals. The Operator uses this context to plan work.
    
    Alternatively, you can import an existing GitHub repository if you already have code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect GitHub">
    AgentOS needs access to GitHub to create repositories and open pull requests. You can provide:
    - A personal access token (PAT) with `repo` scope
    - Or configure a project-specific token later
    
    <Note>
      The `repo` scope gives agents permission to create repositories, push code, and manage pull requests.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you complete onboarding, AgentOS creates your workspace and you're ready to go.

## Your first conversation

After setup, you land in the Operator tab. This is where you communicate with the AI.

Try asking it something like:

- "What's the current state of my product?"
- "Create a landing page for my app"
- "Set up authentication with email and password"

The Operator breaks down your request into tasks, assigns them to agents, and tracks progress. You can watch agents work in real-time from the Flow tab.

## Connect Vercel (optional)

To enable automatic deployments, add your Vercel token in the workspace settings. Once connected, agents can deploy your code directly to Vercel.
